            <h1>About Me</h1>

            <p>I am from Sacramento, California, and I attended Brigham Young University as
            an undergraduate majoring in Statistics (with an emphasis in data
            science) and Russian. I chose Russian as one of my majors because I
            lived in Ukraine for two years as a church missionary immediately
            following high school. I learned Russian during that time by speaking
            with strangers on a daily basis, which led to my deep love for the
            language and culture of that region of the world. Someday I hope to
            learn Ukrainian as well!</p>
            <p>My interest in data science started during my undergrad when I
            attended a university forum featuring Dr. DJ Patil--the former United
            States Chief Data Scientist under the Obama Administration. His remarks
            on the power of data to solve social problems in the world inspired me
            to pursue a career in data science. I am especially interested in this
            application of data science--addressing social problems through data.</p>
            <p>Aside from my academic interests, I love watching movies (especially
            Star Wars), collecting posters and LEGOs, going on runs, and
            reading.</p>
