            <h1>About Me</h1>

            <p>I am from Sacramento, California, and I attended Brigham Young University as an undergraduate majoring in Statistics (with an emphasis in data science) and Russian. I chose Russian as one of my majors because I lived in Ukraine for two years as a church missionary immediately following high school. I learned Russian during that time by speaking with strangers on a daily basis, which led to my deep love for the language and for Slavic culture.</p>
            <p>My interest in data science started during my undergrad when I attended a university forum featuring Dr. DJ Patil&mdash;the former United States Chief Data Scientist under the Obama Administration. His remarks on the power of data to solve social problems in the world inspired me to pursue a career in data science. I am especially interested in this application of data science&mdash;addressing social problems through data.</p>
            <p>Aside from my academic interests, I love watching movies (especially Star Wars), collecting posters and LEGOs, going on runs, and reading. I am a deep thinker and an inquisitive learner. I am inspired by the illuminating works of Russian authors who comment on human suffering, teaching me to care deeply about social disparities.</p>
